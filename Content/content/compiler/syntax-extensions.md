Since its creation camlp4 has proven to be a very useful tool. People
have used it to experiment with new features for OCaml and to provide
interesting meta-programming facilities. However, there is general
agreement that camlp4 is too powerful and complex for the applications
that it is most commonly used for, and there is a growing movement to
provide a simpler alternative.

A working group was formed (wg-camlp4@lists.ocaml.org) regarding the
future of syntax extensions in OCaml. The aim of the working group is
to formulate a solid transition plan to create a 'basic OCaml
ecosystem' that does not require camlp4. Alain Frisch's introductory
email has more detail and can be

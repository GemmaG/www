The Mirage developer preview aims to be a stable release of the Mirage tools
and libraries in OPAM, and a simple (tested) "Getting started guide" on the
wiki.

The three target applications are to build and run:

  1.  a self-hosting website and DNS server (without SSL)
  2.  stub-domains for xenstore and xenconsoled, demonstrating how mirage can be used to build critical infrastructure.
  3.  simple distributed system using multiple communicating Mirage instances

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is probably the most widely deployed security
protocol on the Internet. It is used to setup virtual private networks, secure
various services such as web and email, etc. For MirageOS, we developed a clean
slate TLS implementation developed in OCaml. Our motivating goals are
reliability, robustness, and API conciseness.

A [BitCoin Pinata](http://ownme.ipredator.se/) was issued in Feb 2015 to help
publically audit the end-to-end TLS and MirageOS stack.

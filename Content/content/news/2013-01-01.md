There's a lot of interest in the work we're doing, and the number of collaborative [projects](../tasks/index.html) is increasing fast. 
We held the first monthly meeting in the Computer Lab, where [Anil](../people/avsm.html) provided
an overview of the [research work](../tasks/index.html) that OCaml Labs is
starting. An interesting theme of the discussion that followed was
related to undergraduate teaching and how things like the [OCaml
Platform](../tasks/platform.html) and infrastructure would make it easier for
students to get to grips with programming.  

For the evening after the meeting, [Amir](../people/amirmc.html) set up 
an informal OCaml hacking/tutorial session in Cambridge.  Around 15 eager 
people attended the event in [Makespace](http://makespace.org) (a community 
workshop), with most of them being new to the language.  Anil introduced 
[Real World OCaml](../tasks/outreach.html#Book%20review%20site) 
and shared the 
introductory chapters while Thomas provided help with OPAM.  This turned out 
to be a great test of the installation process for newcomers to OCaml, as 
well as the book's instructions. A number of issues came to light, partly 
related to a perfect storm of package issues, which everyone is keen to 
improve.  Despite these problems, attendees were very positive and were keen 
to see more gatherings like this in future.  When Amir asked for feedback, 
pretty much everyone commented on how great the pizza was.

### Platform projects

OCaml Labs also hosted its first visitor this month as [Thomas
Gazagnaire](../people/tg.html), the CTO of OCamlPro, spent three weeks in
Cambridge.  Much effort was put into preparing Mirage for release, discussions
about parallelism and the OCaml Platform, and anything where OPAM is a crucial
component.  Worth noting is that (at time of writing) the 
[opam-repository](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository) has now 
become the [overall most forked OCaml project on Github](https://github.com/languages/OCaml).  
The [Platform mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/platform/) 
has also been formed for discussion regarding the OCaml Platform.  Anyone 
interested in the discussions about the platform, which will include 
development on OPAM, should join this list.

Part of the Platform work involves creating a new 
[design for OCaml.org](../tasks/platform.html), which also 
[kicked-off this week](http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-February/000194.html).  
Amir will keep people updated about progress via updates to the 
[OCL website](../tasks/outreach.html#OCaml.org%20redesign), 
[Infrastructure mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/) and also by posting things to the 
[OCaml.org Github wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki).  The 
current stage of work involves thinking of the types of pages OCaml.org 
requires, in order to refine the templates we need.  As part of this, we 
also commissioned a new logo for OCaml and although it's still under 
development, you can see the latest draft on the 
[OCaml.org wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos).
  Please send any feedback directly to Amir.

The Real World OCaml book website was released as a 
[limited alpha](http://www.realworldocaml.org) earlier in the month, with 
the aim of getting early feedback and comments. Each paragraph of the online 
book has commenting functionality, using Github issues as a backend.  This 
means that each comment made on the book website creates a new issue on 
Github, which authors/commenters can track and discuss before editing the 
content.  So far there have been over 250 comments on the alpha, with half 
them being dealt with already.

A new EU project also kicked-off called [Trilogy 2](../tasks/t2.html), which builds on the 
award-winning work from the original [Trilogy](http://www.trilogy-project.org) project.  OnApp (a member of Trilogy 2), will be providing the [cloud Infrastructure for ocaml.org](http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/infrastructure/2013-February/000198.html), and Thomas and Anil will be expanding the Mirage project into distributed computing under this umbrella.  As befits an EU project, it kicked off with an especially nice dinner at [Christ's College](http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk)...

### Systems research

<b>Mirage:</b> This was formally proposed as an 
[incubated Xen.org project](../tasks/mirage.html) and the proposal was put forward for 
[community review](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Mirage_Incubation_Project_Proposal). There were many positive 
comments on the Xen mailing lists (along the lines of 
["Mirage is cool stuff"](http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2013-01/msg01084.html))
and voting is currently underway by eligible members of the Xen community.
Assuming a positive outcome, incubation would give the Mirage project greater
visibility and access to resources.  This would accelerate progress towards an
alpha release in Q1/Q2 this year.  In 
addition to this, a proposal for an 
[OSCON talk](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013) was also submitted and the camera-ready version of the ASPLOS paper is 
[now available](http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf).  

<b>Illuminate</b>: A related research topic where Mirage could be useful is in embedded systems 
and the Internet of Things.  One specific use case is the 
[Illuminate Project](../tasks/illuminate.html), where Mirage can be used 
to create appliances running on the ARM microcontrollers alongside an LED 
lighting network.  Such a lighting system is now deployed in large parts of 
the Computer Laboratory and will form an excellent test-bed to explore these 
ideas further.

<b>Signpost:</b>: <a href="../images/t2-kickoff-1.jpg"><img class="right" width="130px" src="../images/t2-kickoff-1-thumb.jpg"></img></a>
Signpost is also achieving greater outreach with 
[Jon Crowcroft](../people/crowcroft.html) discussing such technologies at a 
meeting in Dagstul on [Decentralized Systems for Privacy
Preservation](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=13062).
Cambridge also hosted [Eric Schmidt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt)
from Google, where he is the Humanitas Visiting Professor in Media for 2013.
Eric delivered a [talk](http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/2332/) on the future
of conflict, combat and intervention.  Anil and Jon got an opportunity to
discuss Signposts with him for 20 minutes, which was an interesting clash of
opinions (we want decentralised identity, Google want it all to go through
them).  Either way, we're even more motivated to get the Signpost tech out to
the big bad world as soon as possible.  Meanwhile, Haris found his identical
twin brother in [St Johns Masters Lodge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge#The_Master.27s_Lodge_and_Garden)...

### Compiler projects

Several mailing lists are in progress for various community-driven projects.
The first of these is a working group on the future of syntax extensions in 
OCaml ([wg-camlp4](http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/wg-camlp4)).  This group is 
chaired by [Alain Frisch](http://alain.frisch.fr) and Leo White and has 
generated a great deal of discussion in the last two weeks.  Leo is 
summarising his thoughts in a series of [blog posts](http://www.lpw25.net) 
as he goes.  Further working groups on parallelism in OCaml and build systems are under 
discussion and will be announced in due course.  

As well as all the research and development activity we've also been 
recruiting.  We've had several rounds of interviews and made a number of 
offers so hopefully we'll be announcing new members of the OCaml Labs team 
in the coming months.  In addition, we'd also like to mention that Leo 
successfully defended his PhD Thesis in January.  Finally, we'd like to 
welcome a new honorary member of OCaml Labs, Nathan Scott, born on 30th 
January.  Congratulations [Dave](../people/djs.html)!

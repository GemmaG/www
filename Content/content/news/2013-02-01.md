Two new people joined the core team at Cambridge: [Jeremy Yallop](../people/yallop.html) and [Philippe Wang](../people/pwang.html)!
Jeremy has extensive expertise with meta-programming and generic programming,
and is initially looking at the [camlp4 redesign](../tasks/compiler.html#Camlp4%20redesign).
Philippe has been taking on the challenge of running OCaml well on restricted embedded systems, which
will also have knock-on benefits to x86 compilation with the same optimisations.
[Xavier Clerc](http://www.x9c.fr) also joined us for a day in advance of his
visit in April, with much interest in his [Argot](http://argot.x9c.fr) project
and the upcoming [redesign of OCaml.org](../tasks/outreach.html#OCaml.org%20redesign).

Two new research grants have been awarded that are relevant to the OCaml Labs mission:

* [Network-as-a-Service](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/K032968/1) is a 3-year grant to solve pressing problems in "Big Data" processing, and will enable us to continue to develop [MirageOS](http://openmirage.org) and the use of OCaml and functional programming in this space.  We're going to be collaborating with Imperial and Nottingham on this, with the Cambridge efforts led by [Andrew Moore](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~awm22/), [Jon Crowcroft](../people/crowcroft.html) and [Anil Madhavapeddy](../people/avsm.html).
* [Rigorous Engineering of Mainstream Systems](http://rems.io) asks how we can use rigorous maths to improve the quality of mainstream computer systems.  It is led by [Peter Sewell](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20) at Cambridge, and most of the tools (including [Ott](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/) and [Lem](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sao/lem/)) are written in OCaml and will benefit from the ongoing work at OCaml Labs.

### Platform projects

<b>OPAM</b>: <a href="../images/rdc-talk.jpg"><img class="right" width="130px" src="../images/rdc-talk-thumb.jpg"></img></a>
We've been working hard on an OPAM 1.0 release, and Thomas and Anil have been sweeping through the package tree to stabilise the repository via automated builds.
We also had a brilliant visit from [Roberto Di Cosmo](http://www.dicosmo.org/index.html.en) from [PPS](http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr), who has contributed extensively to the open-source community over the years.  He gave a talk on the [challenges of handling large-scale versioning](http://upsilon.cc/~zack/research/publications/infsof2012-mpm.pdf) of packages from a mathematical perspective (particularly applied to Debian), which is very useful input for the ongoing OPAM work.

<b>Mailing lists</b>: A new <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/opengl">opengl@lists.ocaml.org</a> was
set up for those interested in OpenGL and WebGL on OCaml, and discussion so far
has covered LabGL on the Raspberry Pi. There are also still plans to begin
working groups for build systems and parallelism but will be announced in due
course once the preparatory work has been completed.

<b>Real World OCaml</b>: The book is now on [alpha3](http://www.realworldocaml.org),
where Part 1 is nearly complete.  New sections on installation and a more
expanded prologue have also been included in this version.

<b>Redesign: </b> As part of the [redesign
work](../tasks/outreach.html#OCaml.org%20redesign), and to showcase the kind of
additional functionality we'd like to create, Amir put together a set of
screencasts that talk though a wireframe demo of the new site.  These short
videos covered elements of design, the new documentation system and an overview
of how the continuous integration system would work.  You can read more and
experience the clickable demo via [Amir's blog post](http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg).

### Systems and compiler projects

<b>Mirage</b>: Anil gave two tech talks about [Mirage](http://openmirage.org) this month at Citrix and Microsoft Research, as practise talks for [ASPLOS 2013](http://asplos13.rice.edu). Mirage itself is nearing a release, and [Vincent Bernardoff](https://github.com/vbmithr) has joined the Citrix engineering team to help drive it to release. He's been primarily focussed on the build frontend (dubbed [Mirari](../tasks/mirage.html#Mirari)) to make Mirage applications easier to compile out-of-the-box.

<b>camlp4 redesign:</b> There has been more discussion about the future of camlp4 and [Leo posted another summary](http://www.lpw25.net/2013/02/05/camlp4-alternative-part-2.html) on his thoughts for an alternative apporach to quotations.

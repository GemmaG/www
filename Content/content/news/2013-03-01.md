The OCaml Labs hackers continue to arrive, with [David
Sheets](../people/sheets.html) arriving from sunny San Francisco, and [Xavier Clerc](../people/xclerc.html) visiting from the less-sunny
[INRIA](http://www.inria.fr) in France.  David's done great work on several
OCaml libraries such as [Cohttp](http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-cohttp) and on
[WebGL](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll9z1ULtgqo&feature=plcp), and he's diving
straight into a first release of [OCamlot](../tasks/platform.html) before
starting his PhD later in the year. Xavier will
work on releasing his [OCaml Java
2.0](http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/preview/) rewrite this summer, which takes
advantage of all the latest JDK features for non-Java languages.

A new research grant has also been awarded to [Jon Crowcroft](../people/crowcroft.html).
The [Hub of All Things](http://hubofallthings.wordpress.com) is a Â£1.2m multi-disciplinary
project funded by the [RCUK Digital Economy Programme](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/xrcprogrammes/Digital/Pages/home.aspx) and led by 
[Irene Ng](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/people/profile/?wmgid=849) 
in Warwick.  HAT aims to create a home platform, under the user's control, 
where a market to exchange their personal data for new products and 
personalised services could exist.  The Cambridge piece of this work will use
[Mirage](../tasks/mirage.html) for embedded systems programming, and
[Signpost](http://signpost.io), to enable devices to connect and communicate
with each-other across the edge network.

### Platform projects


<b>OPAM: </b> [OPAM](http://opam.ocamlpro.com), the popular OCaml Package Manager, recently had its [1.0
release](http://www.ocamlpro.com/blog/2013/03/14/opam-1.0.0.html)!  OPAM has
been in development for just over a year, and this is a significant milestone
for the project.  The OPAM [package repository](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/issues) has had over 500 issues, closed over 400 pull requests and now contains over 450 packages
(and more than twice that number if you consider that multiple versions are
available).  This kind of user adoption is a fantastic sign for the OCaml
community.  We're very happy to be using OPAM as a key piece of the upcoming
OCaml Platform and the continuous integration and test system.

<b>OCaml.org redesign:</b> Amir extended the Balsamiq mockups into more
realistic static site designs that can be [found on the
wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Site-Redesign).  We're building
on the theme we began with the [OCaml Logo](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos), but also
including the full functionality we want for the revamped site.  The samples
should give people an idea of the colour schemes and images we'll be using, and
feedback is *very* welcome.  Next, we're creating the HTML/CSS templates we
need to make these mockups a reality.

<b>OCamlot</b>: Within hours of getting off the plane, David was already 
getting well into the OCaml-based test tool and working on the pieces we 
need to get to a usable first version.  The OCamlot workflow was last 
described in Amir's
[Balsamiq mockups](http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg/)
in case you want to catch up.  This work is made all the more important as 
Jane Street continues to demonstrate their strong commitment to open-source 
by sending in OPAM pull requests 
[every week](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-repository/pull/644) 
for new releases of their [libraries](http://janestreet.github.io).  The 
testing for these releases is currently handled manually and we're really 
looking forward to having them dealt with automatically!

### Systems projects

<a href="../images/asplos-mort.jpg"><img class="right" width="120px" thumb="ASPLOS served green drinks. Hmm" src="../images/asplos-mort-thumb.jpg"></img></a>
<b>Mirage</b>: There is much preparation ongoing for the big 
[xen.org incubation](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Mirage_Incubation_Project_Proposal), 
which has now been approved by the Xen community board. Vincent's work on 
[Mirari](../tasks/mirage.html) is going very well, and he's updated the 
[Mirage installation](http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/install) instructions 
to use Mirari instead of the manual process required before. 
[Anil](../people/avsm.html) and [Mort](../people/mort.html) also attended 
and presented the 
[ASPLOS 2013](http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-asplos-mirage.pdf) paper in 
Houston.  For the curious, 
[Ben's Beans](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/bens-beans-houston) is the only good 
coffee we could find suitable for a European in Texas.

<b>Irminsule</b>: Now that the core of Mirage is heading for release, the 
team is turning their attention to the storage and distributed programming 
challenge. [Thomas](../people/tg.html) and Anil have been working on a new 
policy-free, branch-consistent storage layer that exposed a raw git-like 
universe to Mirage applications. We're working on as part of the 
[Trilogy2](../tasks/t2.html) that's investigating how to improve the 
reliability of congested datacenters.

<a href="../images/heidi-signposts.jpg"><img class="right" width="130px" src="../images/heidi-signposts-thumb.jpg"></img></a>
<b>Signposts</b>: [Heidi](../people/heidi.html) gave an *excellent* talk 
about Signpost and the benefits it can offer internet users today
<i>(see right)</i>. This was one of a set of talks that took place in the 
Computer Lab, organised by [Alan Mycroft](../people/mycroft.html), on open 
software and open hardware with speakers such as
[Jon 'maddog' Hall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Hall_(programmer)) of
Linux International. There was fairly unanimous agreement that Heidi's 
slides were better than Anil's.

### Compiler projects

<b>Multicore</b>: Once the dreaded ICFP deadline was out of the way, 
Stephen, Leo, Raphael and Anil put their heads together to start 
architecting the support for parallel multicore support in the OCaml runtime.
A key part of the design space is to maintain the sequential performance and 
simplicity of the existing runtime, but still make it easy to extend shared 
memory onto different cores.  We'll have more details on this shortly when 
early prototypes are done and some benchmarks run.

<b>Namespaces:</b> Leo's also been extremely busy in the 
[platform mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/platform), which has 
been the location for the discussion of namespaces.  A few hundred emails 
have been exchanged on this topic and Leo has summarised the discussion and 
made proposals in his blog post about 
[OCaml namespaces](http://www.lpw25.net/2013/03/10/ocaml-namespaces.html).  Although this is a complex issue, aspects of namespaces will be important to 
the work on the OCaml Platform so we look forward to the outcome of these 
discussions.

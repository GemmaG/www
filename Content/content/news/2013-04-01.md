It's been a heads-down month of hacking at the Labs for April, as the
group have settled into their projects and are concentrating on getting code
out.  We did take the opportunity to redesign the [project pages](../tasks/index.html) as the active projects grew.

We welcomed [Euan Harris](../people/euan.html) as a new visitor, and he has
begun work on a distributed actor library in the vein of Erlang's
[OTP](https://github.com/erlang/otp).  The prolific [Daniel BÃ¼nzli](http://erratique.ch) also joined us for the summer to work on his [Vg](http://erratique.ch/software/vg/) visualisation library.  He's based out of the Citrix offices, and is also contributing to the Xen project.

### Platform projects

<b>OPAM: </b> The project has entered a bug fixing stage after its release, and
the package set has steadily grown via external contributors. David Sheets has
been hacking away on the automated [OCamlot](../tasks/platform.html#OCamlot)
bot, and we released improved [Github](https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github)
API bindings.  We're aiming to get OCamlot live and running in May, so stay
tuned!  There is a [steadily growing
collection](../tasks/platform.html#Machine%20Pool) of odd ARM and PowerPC
devices in Anil's desk that will generally make it easier to test your OCaml
code in unusual environments.

<b>OCaml.org redesign:</b> Progress on the website continues and we're now
working on the actual HTML/CSS from the earlier
[mockups](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Site-Redesign).  We'll be
publishing these in a fork of the website
[repository](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml.org), so do feel free to create
issues there with your comments.  Philippe has begun the
[MPP](../tasks/outreach.html#Meta%20preprocessor) templating tool to glue together
all the website scripts more coherently. Discussions about this take place on
the [infrastructure](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/infrastructure) mailing
list, which is open to all.

The monthly OCaml get togethers in the [Cambridge
Makespace](http://makespace.org) are also really fun.  This month saw around 30
people wander through the doors, and work through the latest excerpts of
[Real World OCaml](http://realworldocaml.org). And around midnight, Jeremy and
Leo competed to find more and more obscure
[bugs](http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view.php?id=5992) in the corners of the
OCaml type system...  You can track the subsequent meetups via the [NonDysFunctional Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-NonDysFunctional-Programmers/events/114286762/), which includes functional programmers from around the Cambridgeshire area.  Jon and Anil also attended the [Yahoo Hackday](http://developer.yahoo.com/events/hack_europe_london/) in London, where Jon met a giant robot and started [SSL bindings](https://github.com/jonludlam/mssl), and Anil experimented with [js_of_ocaml LocalStorage](http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-js-localstorage) for Irminsule.

### Systems projects

<b>Mirage</b>: We've finally got a release date for the first preview of
Mirage, which will be at [O'Reilly OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/28956) this July!  Pulling together the release is a big endeavour, and the
[team](../tasks/mirage.html) has started weekly calls to work through the
project.  The minutes for these are online, so you can
[browse](http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/tag/overview/meetings) them to catch
up. There's also a slightly scary
[checklist](http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/dev-preview-checklist) of all the
libraries that need to be released before July, so the team has its work cut
out for it!  The Xen group also announced that it is joining the Linux Foundation,
and the [press release](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2013/04/xen-become-linux-foundation-collaborative-project) gave Mirage a prominent mention as one of the key recent developments in Xen.

<b>Irminsule</b>: Thomas now has a full implementation of the git file format
in his [cagit](http://github.com/samoht/cagit) repository, and the interfaces
for Irminsule's branch-consistent model are coming together.  He gave a demo to
the Mirage team, with [discussion
notes](http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/weekly-2013-04-23) available.

### Compiler projects

<b>Multicore and Concurrency</b>: Stephen Dolan's made great progress on bringing up a multicore
runtime using [thread-local storage](https://github.com/stedolan/ocaml), which results
in a surprisingly compact diff to the OCaml runtime.  We're now moving onto the
higher-level bindings to use the parallel runtimes effectively from within OCaml.
We also began a [wg-parallel](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/wg-parallel) working
group in order to start figuring out the evolution of the [Lwt](http://ocsigen.org/lwt) and 
[Async](https://github.com/janestreet/async) concurrency libraries.

<b>libffi</b>: Jeremy got frustrated by the difficulty of writing safe C bindings,
and started the [ctypes](http://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes) library, which
offers a pure OCaml solution. This even includes managing callbacks across the
OCaml/C divide, and uses [libffi](https://github.com/atgreen/libffi) under the hood
to remain efficient and platform-independent.  There is the exciting possibility
about hooking this library with the [compile-time metaprogramming](../tasks/compiler.html#Compile-time%20meta%20programming) to eliminate all performance cost, so we're going to spend some time
on this project to make it a well-documented alternative to the existing C FFI.

The OCaml Labs talk series continued with a visit from [Francois
Pottier](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/) ad [Jonathan
Protzenko](http://www.xulforum.org) from the INRIA
[Gallium](http://gallium.inria.fr) research team.  Jonathan presented their
[Mezzo](http://gallium.inria.fr/~protzenk/mezzo-lang) language, which places
emphasis on aliasing and controlled access to mutation.  This is of particular
interest to several of our systems projects that do not require the full power of
OCaml to build low-level systems components, and Raphael, Alan, Leo and Anil
had productive discussions about how we could try Mezzo out when it's released.

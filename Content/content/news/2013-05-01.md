May is exam time in Cambridge, and the corridors of the OCaml Labs resounded
with the wailing of frantic students finishing their dissertations and
preparing for exams.  We welcomed [Vincent Botbol](https://github.com/vincent-botbol) to join us for a summer internship,
and he started hacking on the new [opam-doc](../tasks/platform.html#OPAM%20Doc)
right away.

Anil, Thomas, Leo and Amir also visited [Jane
Street](http://janestreet.com) HQ in New York City, where we had a productive
couple of days reviewing our projects and getting feedback from them about
approaches to multicore and type system enhancements. [Ashish
Agarwal](http://ashishagarwal.org) also organised a fun evening with the [New
York OCaml Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-OCaml/events/117222022/),
where Anil and Thomas presented our plans for the nascent OCaml Platform.

### Systems Projects

<b>Mirage:</b> This was a month of consolidation and bugfixing in Mirage.  We've
been settling into weekly meetings to coordinate the hacking between us and
Citrix, and the minutes ([1](http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/weekly-2013-05-14)
[2](http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/weekly-2013-05-21)
[3](http://www.openmirage.org/wiki/weekly-2013-05-28)) may be useful if you
want to catch up.  The biggest bugbear is always the build system, and we've
been exploring the use of [Jenga](http://github.com/janestreet/jenga) as the
eventual async-aware coordination and build system for running Mirage kernels.
Dave made great progress with a
[message-switch](http://github.com/djs55/message-switch) that coordinates
multiple kernels, and Balraj fixed several performance regressions in the
TCP/IP stack by building unit tests that spawn millions of parallel TCP
connections. 

<b>Signpost:</b> We took a break from building prototypes to submit a paper on the
basic design to the USENIX Free and Open Communications ([FOCI
2013](https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci13)) workshop.  Haris and Heidi
blazed a path on writing this paper, and we've got even more ideas rolling
around about how to use DNSSEC to break the cloud deadlock.  The
[ocaml-dns](http://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns) continues to grow features too.

### Platform Projects

<a href="../images/nycoug-drinkup-2013.jpg"><img class="right" src="../images/nycoug-drinkup-2013-thumb.jpg" /></a>
<b>Ctypes:</b> Jeremy
[announced](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/arc/caml-list/2013-06/msg00046.html)
the first release of a new foreign-function mechanism for OCaml that doesn't
require you to write any C stubs at all!  You can browse the [source
code](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes) and
[tutorial](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/wiki/ctypes-tutorial), and
install it via OPAM.  This is very much the first 0.1 release, and we have
exciting future developments to turn this into a full-fledged replacement for
the fast-but-rather-difficult-to-use-right OCaml FFI. 

<b>OPAM-doc:</b> Vincent Botbol started building on Leo's work on the new
[opam-doc](http://github.com/vincent-botbol/opam-doc) tool. This is intended to
replace the venerable `ocamldoc` with one that uses all the latest features of
the compiler.  In particular, it can use the new typed AST `cmt` output to
avoid duplicating the compiler functionality, and can also build up a global
package table to generate complete cross-references across an entire OPAM 
collection.

<b>OCamlot:</b> David has been building up the libraries and tools needed for
the [continuous build](../tasks/platform.html#OCamlot%200.2.0) infrastructure.
This includes much-improved
[ocaml-github](http://github.com/avsm/ocaml-github), bindings, which are now
being used to power the [Real World OCaml](https://realworldocaml.org) site as
well as well as OCamlot.  In addition, he's got an interesting collection of
regular expressions to automatically triage common failures from OPAM
(such as missing external dependencies), that should help reduce the manual
burden of getting thousands of tests results dumped on the small OPAM team.

### Compiler Projects

<a href="../images/janestreet-hq-2013.jpg"><img class="left" src="../images/janestreet-hq-2013-thumb.jpg" /></a>
<b>OCaml-Java</b>: Xavier Clerc has been hacking away at his next-generation
OCaml-Java backend (using many new features in JDK7). He's released a
[preview](http://ocamljava.x9c.fr/preview/concurrency.html) of the bindings to
Java concurrency, and is looking for feedback on it. 

<b>Performance profiling</b>: Mark Shinwell has been hacking on improving the
integration of the runtime with `perf`.  This should give us the hooks to
reliably track where memory was allocated.  His branch isn't going to land in
OCaml 4.1, but should be available as an OPAM switch for people to easily
try out when it's more stable.

### Outreach

<b>OCaml.org:</b> Philippe and Amir have been putting their heads together with
Christophe and Ashish to turn the [ocaml.org](http://ocaml.org) build pipeline
into something a little more structured.  Philippe is building a [template
processor](https://github.com/pw374/MPP-language-blender) for this purpose.
The OCaml site is a more complicated than the average site due to our desire to
embed [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml) interactive toplevels
throughout the tutorials, and also to have active OPAM integration throughout
the site to make it easier for newcomers to sample the language.

The design of a handful of pages are also now available to preview, if you
don't mind some manual git cloning. The best way to do this is to clone the
[temporary repo](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml.org-temp) onto your local
machine and look in the `new-design/_site` directory.  There are examples of
the home page, 100 lines of OCaml page and several others.  Since we're just
getting started with applying these changes the site isn't clicky (yet).  For
some extra fun, try resizing your browser window and see how the pages reflow
to suit smaller (mobile) screens!

<b>Real World OCaml:</b> Anil, Yaron and Jason continue to work hard on getting
a release out of the door.  We shipped a final alpha6 this month that is 
chapter-complete, and have been preparing for a big public June release of
the book.  Thousands of comments have been received and closed already,
making this an unusually active (but incredibly useful) ongoing review
process.  Leo and Jeremy also contributed portions of text for the Objects
and FFI chapters in alpha6, and join Stephen Weeks as external contributors
to the book.

Meanwhile, Leo himself has recovered from the elation of being granted his PhD,
to the harsh reality of having to finish corrections.  He has been forced by
his colleagues to stop hacking on OCaml and submit his final thesis.  Rumours
are that he will reemerge in June after delivering his [SAS
2013](http://staticanalysis.org/SAS13/papers.html) talk on using an
implication-algebra generalisation of logic programming to concisely analyse
OpenMP programs for parallisation opportunities.

This month's talk was courtesy of [Mathias Bourgoin](http://www.lip6.fr/actualite/personnes-fiche.php?ident=D1161&LANG=en),
who visited from France and gave a talk on his PhD work on GPU processing.  His
tool, [SPOC](http://www.algo-prog.info/spoc/web/index.php?id=spoc) has been
released onto OPAM and is a set of easy-to-use tools for generating CUDA and
OpenCL code, and also a camlp4 extension to write external kernels directly in
OCaml.  Thanks for visiting, Mathias!

The aim of this tutorial is to write an implementation of the popular game
2048.   It will be written in pure OCaml and compiles into JavaScript that runs
interactively in a browser on the client-side.

The basic types and stub functions are provided, along with a suite of failing
tests and a front-end that runs the game in a browser. 
See the [instructions](https://github.com/ocamllabs/2048-tutorial/blob/master/task.md) for
more details on the tasks.

This tutorial was run in ICFP 2014 in Sweden, and FuConf 2014 in India.  Please
feel free to use it for your own OCaml tutorials, and let us know if you do so that
we can record it here.

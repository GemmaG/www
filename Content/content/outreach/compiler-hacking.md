The OCaml Labs compiler hacking sessions bring together around twenty people
from OCaml Labs, the wider Computer Lab, and various companies around Cambridge
for an enjoyable few hours to learn about and improving the OCaml compiler
toolchain, fuelled by free pizza.  They run roughly every couple of months,
with the results written up on the [compiler hacking
blog](http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/).

The location moves around Cambridge; we have been in the Computer Lab, Citrix,
the Makespace, and the Postdoc Centre on various occasions. We benefited from
the presence of a few experienced compiler hackers, but for many of us it was
the first attempt to modify the OCaml compiler internals.

If you are in the Cambridge area, please do feel to drop in!  There is a
[mailing list](http://lists.ocaml.org/listinfo/cam-compiler-hacking) to stay
informed of future events.

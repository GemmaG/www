<a href="http://realworldocaml.org"><img class="left" src="../images/oreilly-cover.gif" width="70px" /></a>Growing a language community is more than just technology; we also need a
better online presence, documentation and educational material. We're working
on an O'Reilly book about practical OCaml programming, as well as a comprehensive
revamp of the website to include features such as the interactive [TryOCaml](http://try.ocamlpro.com) Javascript toplevel.

Much of this work is done in collaboration with members
of the wider OCaml community such as [Ashish Agarwal](../people/ashish.html) and [Christophe Troestler](../people/christophe.html), and not just from the Cambridge group.

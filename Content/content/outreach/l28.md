The L28 Advanced Functional Programming course is a masters-level course in the
Cambridge Computer Laboratory.  This module aims to teach students how to use
the features of modern typed functional programming languages (e.g. OCaml,
Haskell) to design and implement libraries and DSLs. It aims to demonstrate how
such techniques can improve both correctness and efficiency.

Students wishing to take the module should have some experience of a typed
functional programming language and an understanding of type inference.

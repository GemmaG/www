[ocaml.org](http://ocaml.org) is the public facing website for OCaml.
A professional agency will be creating a new design for OCaml.org,
with flexible templates that can be used across other OCaml related
sites as people wish. This will include branding work for the OCaml
language itself.

So far we have:

- Created an initial version of the OCaml Logo for feeddback. You can find
it on the
[ocaml.org wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/wiki/Draft-OCaml-Logos)

- Put together wireframes for a complete site redesign. You can read about those on
[Amir's blog post](http://amirchaudhry.com/wireframe-demos-for-ocamlorg) or play with an [interactive wireframe demo](https://ocaml.mybalsamiq.com/projects/public-demo/naked/0_home?key=b897ea86d8a8199c6e46b3295ddf630dfa33e5e1).

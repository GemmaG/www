Online version of the Real World OCaml book. The whole book will be freely readable online under a Creative Commons license. While it is under development, the online version has per-paragraph commenting functionality enabled, with the comments stored as GitHub issues for the authors to manage

With this system, we hope to engage a lot more people in the review
process so that the final version of the book can incorporate feedback
and improvements from the community. Commenting will require a (free)
GitHub account.

The book is currently on alpha4 and several hundred comments from reviewers
have been addressed across the versions.

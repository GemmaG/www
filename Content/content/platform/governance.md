As the projects around the OCaml.org domain name are becoming more
established, it is important to document how the domain-name itself is being
governed.  Therefore we have begun to put together a governance framework that
clarifies the current stakeholders and documents how the domain is currently
managed.  

The intent is to provide clarity around how things operate in reality, rather
than being aspirational.  As such we hope it can be adopted without
introducing burdensome processes, while ensuring that it grow and
develop as the community does.

A brief summary of the growth of the projects and the factors that are part of
the governance document can be found online at:

OPAM 1.2 features a streamlined workflow to improve the day-to-day development
experience, as well as numerous performance and reliability improvements.

* A extended and versatile `opam pin` command, described [here](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-1-2-pin/).
* More expressive queries over the package database, and `opam source` to quickly clone packages.
* New metadata fields for describing source repositories, bug-trackers, and finer control of package behaviour.
* An `opam lint` command to check the quality of packages.

As OPAM gets more widely used for teaching, it's important to make it easy to
distribute and install on a variety of operating systems.  We are firstly
generating binary packages for several Linux distributions (via the OpenSUSE
Build Service and Ubuntu PPAs).  There is also an ongoing effort to package up
an OPAM environment using virtualisation tools such as Vagrant and Docker.
See the task ticket for ongoing progress.

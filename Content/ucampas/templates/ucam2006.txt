This is version 2 of the University of Cambridge house style, released
by Helen Sargan in February 2006 at

  http://www.cam.ac.uk/cambuniv/webstyle/

It is stylistically a minor update to the style originally released in
October 2001, making much better use of CSS (due to dropped Netscape 4
support). The most visible change is that the page title is no longer
appearing in red in the top-right corner of the page, freeing this
place for the name or the organization.

This style is (as of January 2009) used by the Computer Laboratory,
but is meant to be suitable for any department of the University of
Cambridge.

To use this style, additional CSS and and image files will be required
that are not currently included here, but can be found (along with
some files that belong to older house styles) under

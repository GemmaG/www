This is the Wolfson College March 2003 house style, with a number of
updates that have been incorporated since.

With this template (unless this has been modified via the pagecolumns
uconfig parameter), ucampas will also look for image files that will
be automatically be added to the page as a side-bar.

  img-{0,t,1,2,...}.{jpg,gif}

                     Images that will be placed next to the text body.
                     Image 0 is in the top-left, image t is an optional
                     text directly below, images 1,2, etc. are then
                     filled in starting from the right botton and below the
                     top left.

  img-{0,t,1,2,...}  Symbolic link, the content of which is a textual
                     description of an image file, useful for the alt
                     attribute

To use this style, additional CSS and and image files will be required
that are not currently included here, but can be found (along with
some other files) under

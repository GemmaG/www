The goal of OCaml Labs is to push [OCaml](http://ocaml.org/OCaml) and
functional programming forward as a platform, making it a more effective tool
for current users (including significant industrial users (link to people/partners here))
and at the same time growing the appeal of the language, broadening its applicability and popularity
by a combination of technological advancements, creation of community
infrastructure, and public communications.

We are always pleased to discuss collaboration (link here to collaboration) opportunities, and feel free to contact (link to contact info) us directly with any questions.
A core principle of the OCaml Labs is that all of the work done here will be freely released  [available](https://github.com/ocamllabs) under open-source licences, and efforts made to integrate all work upstream (e.g. to INRIAv(link to them here)), who originally developed and have maintained OCaml since its release in 1996).

This effort is run across multiple groups (link here to people) in the Computer Laboratory, primarily the SRG (link to SRG) and PLS (link) and including collaborators from the Security (link), CompArch (link) and DTG (link) groups.   We would like to especially thank our primary funder, [Jane Street](http://janestreet.com), for their generous support (link to specific funding/projects?)

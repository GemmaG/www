<h1>OCaml Labs - Real World Functional Programming</h1>
<p>
The goal of OCaml Labs is to push <a class="icon-external" href="http://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> and
functional programming forward as a platform, making it a more effective tool
for current users (including significant <a href="people.html">industrial users</a>)
and at the same time
growing the appeal of the language, broadening its applicability and popularity
by a combination of technological advancements, creation of community
infrastructure, and public communications.
</p>

<p>We are always pleased to discuss <a class="icon-community" href="collaboration.html">collaboration</a>
opportunities, and feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us directly with any questions.
A core principle of the OCaml Labs is that all of the work done here will be freely
released <a href="publications.html">available</a> under
open-source licenses, and efforts made to integrate all work upstream (e.g. to <a href="http://gallium.inria.fr">INRIA</a>, who originally developed and have maintained OCaml since its release in 1996).</p>

<p>This effort is run across <a href="people/">multiple groups</a> in the Computer Laboratory, including the
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/">SRG</a>, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/cprg/">CPRG</a>
and <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/">DTG</a>.   We would like to especially thank our primary
funder, <a href="http://janestreet.com">Jane Street</a>, for their generous <a class="icon-media" href="people.html#funding">support</a>.</p>

<p>We are still defining a full set of projects for OCamlLabs, but
here are some that we wish to start off immediately.  We are <a class="icon-community" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/collaboration.html">hiring</a>
if you are interested in any of these! This list is also not intended to
be exhaustive, and there is plenty of room for research and experimentation.
</p>
<p>If you are a Part-II or ACS student and want to hack on OCaml for your
project, then there are several good ideas here. Get in touch with
<a href="/~avsm2">Anil Madhavapeddy</a> ,
<a href="/~am21">Alan Mycroft</a>,
<a href="/~iml1">Ian Leslie</a> or
<a href="/~jac22">Jon Crowcroft</a>
to discuss concrete projects.</p>

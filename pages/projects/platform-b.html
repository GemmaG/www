<h1>OCaml Platform</h1>

<p>The OCaml Platform is a collection of libraries, tools and documentation that
is released as a consistent, tested bundle.  It includes the standard OCaml
compiler released by INRIA and community contributions.
The OCaml Platform will be considered a success if it comes out regularly, is
of high quality, and becomes the standard way for developers to get OCaml and
its packages.  This is not a solo effort, as other <a class="icon-community" href="../people.html">collaborators</a>
such as <a href="http://www.ocamlpro.com">OCamlPro</a> are developing packaging and build
systems that form a key part of the overall platform releases.</p>

<p>Building an OCaml Platform community site and infrastructure (continuous build,
hosted packages and cross-platform testing) is one of the first tasks that OCamlLabs
will tackle.  This should be an interesting exercise in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">eating our own dogfood</a>,
as most of the infrastructure is being built in OCaml itself, with many of the
<a href="http://github.com/mirage">libraries</a> written here in Cambridge.
There is a heavy emphasis on automation, such as using <a href="http://xen.org">Xen</a>
to spin up different operating systems as VMs to perform build and unit tests on
all support packages.  The more automation there is, the more we can focus on expanding
and evolving the Platform without regressions.</p>

<p>You can get involved with the OCaml Platform efforts immediately by joining the
<a class="icon-email" href="../contact.html">mailing list</a>.  If you are an industrial user of OCaml
and want to make your needs known, then please do join and speak up!  We will
be regularly updating the main OCaml list with the results of our work, and
updating the <a class="icon-rss" href="../index.html">news</a> page. And of course, remember that
we are <a class="icon-directory" href="../collaboration.html">hiring</a> at several levels!</p>

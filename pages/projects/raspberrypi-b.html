<p>OCaml for <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rdm34/raspi/">Raspberry Pi</a> (partly) works straight
out of the box on Raspbian.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are (as yet) no pre-compiled ARMv6 binaries suitable to download
so it's currently necessary to download the source tree and build it yourself.</p>

<p>Just download the latest version (you need the "source tarball" ocaml-4.00.0.tar.gz ) from
<a href="http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/release.en.html">http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/release.en.html</a>,
<br> unzip it with <tt>tar zxf ocaml-4.00.0.tar.gz</tt> and
<br> read the files in capital letters, such as <tt>INSTALL</tt>, for (the usual) instructions, which can be abbreviated to:
<pre>
$ ./configure
$ make world
$ sudo make install
</pre>
<p>This (assuming default options) provides "ocaml" (and others) executable binaries in /usr/local/bin
which is on the default Raspbian search path.</p>

<p>Also note that the ARM native code OCaml compiler ("make opt") does not yet work
(we presume this is ARMv6 and ARMv7 instruction set differences).</p>

<p>The OCaml <a href="http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/index.html">manuals</a> is available from the above download site too.

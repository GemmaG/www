Potentially desirable features:

- JavaScript/CSS menues
  (e.g. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Superfish
  http://www.youngpup.net/projects/transmenus/,
  http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dropdowns/,
  http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/03/14/css-based-navigation-menus-modern-solutions/,
  http://script.aculo.us/)
- automatic JavaScript-based (de)obfuscation of email addresses (anti-spam)
- automatically use CDATA in <script></script> and perhaps even add
  JavaScript comments if the script type attribute allows this
- provide option to disable automatic use of absolute URLs if
  a target file is not locally visible when ucampas runs
  (this behaviour may be desirable in cases of partial repository
  checkout, but can be a hindrance otherwise, e.g. requiring two
  "ucampas -r" passes on the main site, and hindering the testing of
  secondary servers) [Piete Brooks, 2007-05; Martyn Johnson, 2007-06-05]
- <div class="ucampas-include">"relative-url",fixurls=0</div> extracts
  body from target file and inserts it here
- include facility for plaintext (ucampas-include-plain)
- parameter autochild=1 behaves as *glob("*/index-b.html", "*-b.html")
  had been appended to uconfig.txt
- uconfig.txt requires *.html suffix to apply attributes, but if it
  is missing, -r will still find the file (presumably via command-line
  logic), perhaps similar normalization as is applied in the -r case
  should be applied to uconfig.txt list elements? [Martyn Johnson, 2007-06-04]
- perhaps commit-update.pl should output a warning if "svn update"
  reports a "C"onflict or mer"G"e.
- commit-update.pl should immediately ucampas the associated index.html
  file if a uconfig.txt file has changed, to ensure that the uconfig.txt file
  is syntax checked
- ucampas should (have an option to) deduplicate the list of specified files
  (which could benefit commit-update.pl), e.g. the count of processed
  files (and errors!) could be turned into a "been here" hash table
- make template files Perl-free, such that they can be added safely to
  the site repository
- ucam2008 tabs
- ucam2008 inner tabs, possibly using CSS from
  http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/cam-only/offices/hr/policy/severance/retirement/requirements/
  layout.css:ul#nav-tabbed
  http://upload.sms.csx.cam.ac.uk/
- HTML5 parser
- try not to abort at first syntax error (Neil Dodgson)
- prevent inclusion of index.html in uconfig.txt
- prevent inclusion of / in uconfig.txt
- avoid dependency on modules not in "man perlmodlib" of Perl 5.8.1
  (e.g., HTTP::Date)
- skipitems and maxitems for ucampas-filelist
- replace u.. with something more Windows-friendly (no trailing dots as
  NTFS can't do these, no symlink as Windows can't do these and web robots
  may find them)
